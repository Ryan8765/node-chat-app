Modules Used in Project

1. Path 
	- documentation - https://nodejs.org/api/path.html
	- Using this to set up connecting the server to the html files by using the path.join method.  This allows us to get access to the public folder from the server.js file without the URI going into the server and then back out of the server file. 

2. Express
	- documenation - http://expressjs.com/

3. Socket IO
	- makes it easy to set up a server that allows communication from front end to back end via the server.
	- You get access to a route that accepts incoming connections and we got access to a javascript library. localhost:3000/socket.io.js
